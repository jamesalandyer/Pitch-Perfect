# Pitch Perfect iOS Application #

This app allows you to record your voice, then add filters to your voice. You can change the speed and pitch of your voice to pre-set values. You can also create a custom sound by choosing your own speed and pitch. It will also show you the length of the recording and let you go back to re-record your voice.

# Running The Project #
You can download the project and run the Pitch Perfect.xcodeproj file in the iOS simulator.
